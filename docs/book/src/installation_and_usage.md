# Installation

## Requirements

- CMake >= 3.15
- Qt 5.15.x or Qt6 >= 6.2
- Ninja (Other generators might work but are untested)
- C++17 capable compiler. Minimum VS2019 on Windows.
- Qt X11Extras module if on Linux/X11
- Qt Quick and QuickControls2 modules if using the QtQuick support
- Qt private development headers, for instance, for Qt5:
  - SUSE: libqt5-qtbase-private-headers-devel
  - Ubuntu, debian-based: qtbase5-private-dev
  - Fedora, redhat-based: qt5-qtbase-private-devel
  - others: consult your distro

## Building

You can skip building manually and instead consume KDDockWidgets via [vcpkg](#using-via-vcpkg).

Although the build system supports many options, you'll mostly use `-DKDDockWidgets_QT6=ON`, or `OFF` for `Qt 5`.

By default, KDDW will be built with support for both `QtWidgets` and `QtQuick`. If you want to save some binary space and compile time,
consider passing `-DKDDockWidgets_FRONTENDS="qtwidgets"` or `-DKDDockWidgets_FRONTENDS="qtquick"`.

Open a terminal capable of building Qt applications (make sure you have cmake, ninja, compiler, Qt, etc in PATH) and run:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/where/to/install ../path/to/kddockwidgets
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```

If you don't have Qt in PATH, then you'll also need `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/<path_to_qt>/5.15/gcc_x64/` (adjust to your case). It's important that this path contains the `lib/cmake/` folder, otherwise you'll get errors about Qt not being found.

Feel free to use your favorite IDE instead.

The installation directory defaults to `c:\KDAB\KDDockWidgets-<version>` on Windows
and `/usr/local/KDAB/KDDockWidgets-<version>` on non-Windows.

Change the installation location by passing the option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path` to CMake.


## Using

Now that you've built and installed KDDW, you can use it.

Let's start by building an example:

```bash
cd path/to/kddockwidgets/examples/dockwidgets/
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/where/to/install
cmake --build .
./bin/qtwidgets_dockwidgets
```

## Linking your own app to KDDockWidgets

You can simply inspect the examples to see how it's done. But the gist is:

Edit your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
find_package(KDDockWidgets REQUIRED) // For Qt6, use KDDockWidgets-qt6 instead here.
...
target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE KDAB::kddockwidgets)
```
Finally, don't forget to build your app with `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/installed/kddw/`.

## Using with Non-CMake build systems

When consuming KDDW via `CMake` some details are implicitly setup for you. If you don't use `CMake` then you'll need to do the following manually:
- `KDDW_FRONTEND_QT` needs to be defined.
- `KDDW_FRONTEND_QTWIDGETS` needs to be defined, if QtWidgets.
- `KDDW_FRONTEND_QTQUICK` needs to be defined, if QtQuick.

The above can be achieved by passing, for example `-DKDDW_FRONTEND_QT -DKDDW_FRONTEND_QTWIDGETS` to your compiler. <br><br>
Additionally, the include path needs to be setup. This is usually `${YOUR_KDDW_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/`
<br><br>
And finally, the library needs to be linked against. It's called `libkddockwidgets.so` (Qt5) or `libkddockwidgets-qt6.so` (Qt6). On Windows it's called `kddockwidgets2.lib` or `kddockwidgets-qt62.lib`, respectively. Note that debug builds are suffixed with `d`, for example `kddockwidgets2d.lib`.

## Using via vcpkg

Simply installing `KDDockWidgets` with `vcpkg` will pull in Qt and its dependencies
which can take up to an hour to build. If you prefer to use your system's Qt installation instead,
pass `-DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=no_qt_overlay` to the CMake configure step.

Here we'll build our example `kddockwidgets/examples/vcpkg/` for illustration purposes. You can copy `vcpkg.json` and
`no_qt_overlay/` into your own project.

Adjust the triplet as needed.

```bash
cd kddockwidgets/examples/vcpkg/
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git # typically added as a git submodule
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-linux-dynamic -DVCPKG_OVERLAY_PORTS=no_qt_overlay -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -S . -B build/
cmake --build build
```
